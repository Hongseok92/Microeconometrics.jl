# Microeconometrics.jl

This package provides support for microeconometric estimation.
It supports complex covariance structures (clustered, etc.) and weighted data.
Please report bugs by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/lbittarello/Microeconometrics.jl/issues/new).
Information on specific versions can be found on the
[release page](https://github.com/lbittarello/Microeconometrics.jl/releases).

## Supported estimators

More models are planned.
If your preferred model is not currently available,
